# Custom Wordlists

Tools such as Hashcat can be used to generate custom wordlists. We can use Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists. Hashcat uses a specific syntax to define characters, words, and their transformations.

CeWL can be used to scan potential words from a company's website and save them in a separate list. We can then combine this list with the desired rules to create a customized password list - one that has a higher probability of containing the correct password for an employee. We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider `-d`, the minimum length of the word `-m`, the storage of the found words in lowercase `--lowercase`, as well as the file where we want to store the results `-w`.

```shell
clue@machine[/]$ cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist
clue@machine[/]$ wc -l inlane.wordlist

326
```
