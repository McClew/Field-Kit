# Field Kit

> ## Field Manual
>
> The Field Manual serves as a comprehensive and practical reference guide for conducting cybersecurity assessments and penetration tests. It has been designed and structured around the core phases of the **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**, providing a systematic approach to security engagements.
>
> While incorporating some minor deviations for practical utility, the manual largely adheres to the PTES Technical Guidelines, which define a standardised methodology for penetration testing.
>
> For more detailed information on the foundational principles and technical aspects that underpin this manual's structure, please refer to the official PTES website: [http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES\_Technical\_Guidelines](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines).
>
> This manual aims to distil complex methodologies and accumulated knowledge into an easily accessible format, enabling users to quickly locate and apply relevant information across all stages of a penetration testing engagement.
