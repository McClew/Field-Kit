# Pentesting Knowledge Base

This repository is a personal knowledge base and collection of notes from my journey to learn penetration testing. It's a living document of the information I've gathered and compiled while studying.

Think of this as my public notebook. I hope it's a helpful resource for anyone else on a similar learning path.
