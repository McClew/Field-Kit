# Pre-Engagement

This section provides information on the foundational activities and preparatory steps undertaken before any technical penetration testing or cybersecurity assessment commences. This crucial phase is predominantly administrative and contractual, focusing on establishing a clear understanding, legal framework, and logistical parameters for the engagement.

Key areas covered in this section include:

* **Scoping:** Defining the precise boundaries, targets, and systems within the assessment's scope.
* **Rules of Engagement (ROE):** Detailing the authorized methodologies, permitted actions, forbidden activities, and communication protocols during the test.
* **Legal Agreements:** Ensuring all necessary contracts, Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), and liability waivers are in place.
* **Logistics & Communication:** Arranging access, establishing points of contact, scheduling, and defining reporting requirements.

The objective of the Pre-Engagement phase is to prevent misunderstandings, minimise risks, and ensure the assessment proceeds ethically, legally, and effectively; setting the stage for a successful and valuable security evaluation.
