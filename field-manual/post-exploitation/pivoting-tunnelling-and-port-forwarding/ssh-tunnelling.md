# SSH Tunnelling

SSH tunnelling, also known as SSH port forwarding, allows for the creation of secure tunnels for network traffic over an SSH connection. This is an incredibly versatile technique used for a variety of purposes, including bypassing firewalls, accessing internal services, and encrypting otherwise unencrypted traffic.

## Example Commands:

```bash
ssh -L [LOCAL_PORT]:[DESTINATION_HOST]:[DESTINATION_PORT] [USER]@[SSH_SERVER_IP]
```

```bash
ssh -R [REMOTE_PORT]:[DESTINATION_HOST]:[DESTINATION_PORT] [USER]@[SSH_SERVER_IP]
```

```bash
ssh -D [LOCAL_PORT] [USER]@[SSH_SERVER_IP]
```

### Key SSH Flags:

* `-L`: Local Port Forwarding
* `-R`: Remote Port Forwarding
* `-D`: Dynamic Port Forwarding (SOCKS Proxy)
* `-N`: Do not execute a remote command (useful for just forwarding ports)
* `-f`: Go to background after authentication
* `-g`: Allow remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports (useful for sharing a forwarded port with other attackers)
* `-C`: Compression enable
* `-q`: Quiet mode
