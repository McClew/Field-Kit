# SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding

Dynamic port forwarding creates a SOCKS proxy on your local machine, allowing you to route _any_ application's traffic through the SSH connection to the remote server. This is the most flexible type of forwarding as it doesn't tie you to a specific destination port or host.

> **Scenario:** You want to browse the internet or scan an internal network through a compromised host (`compromised-server.example.com`) that has internet access or access to the internal network.

## Command:

```bash
ssh -D 1080 user@compromised-server.example.com
```

### Explanation:

* `-D 1080`: Creates a SOCKS proxy on your local machine on port `1080`.
* `user@compromised-server.example.com`: The SSH credentials and address of the compromised host.

Once the tunnel is established, you need to configure your applications (e.g., web browser, Nmap, curl) to use `localhost:1080` as a SOCKS proxy.

Example with ProxyChains (for CLI tools): Edit `/etc/proxychains.conf` or `~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf` and add:

```bash
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```

Then run your command through `proxychains`:

```bash
proxychains firefox
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn 192.168.0.0/16
```

## Use Cases:

* Full network pivoting for reconnaissance and further exploitation.
* Bypassing network egress filtering.
* Accessing services on an internal network dynamically.
* Browse the internet as if you were on the remote network.
