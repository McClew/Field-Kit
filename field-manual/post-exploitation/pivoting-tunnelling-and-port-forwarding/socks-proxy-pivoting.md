# SOCKS Proxy Pivoting

SOCKS (Sockets Secure) proxy pivoting allows an attacker to route network traffic through a compromised host, effectively making the compromised host act as a proxy. This is particularly useful for accessing internal network segments or services that are otherwise unreachable from the attacker's machine.

## Proxychains Config

```bash
attacker@machine[~]$ tail -4 /etc/proxychains.conf

# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
```
