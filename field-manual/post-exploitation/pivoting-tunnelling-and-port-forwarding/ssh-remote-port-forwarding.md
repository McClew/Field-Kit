# Remote Port Forwarding

Remote port forwarding allows you to forward a port on the remote SSH server to a port on your local machine. This is useful when you want a service running on your local machine to be accessible from the remote server or other machines on the remote server's network.

> **Scenario:** You have a web server running on your local machine on port `8000`, and you want a remote host (`target.example.com`) to be able to access it. You have SSH access to `target.example.com`.

## Command:

(executed from your local machine)

```bash
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8000 user@target.example.com
```

### Explanation:

* `-R 8080`: Specifies that a remote port `8080` on `target.example.com` will be used.
* `localhost`: Refers to your local machine (from the perspective of the SSH client).
* `8000`: The local port on your machine that is being forwarded.
* `user@target.example.com`: The SSH credentials and address of the remote host.

After executing this command, any machine that can connect to `target.example.com` on port `8080` will have its traffic forwarded back to your local machine's port `8000`.

## Use Cases:

* Exposing a local service to a remote network (e.g., a reverse shell listener).
* Allowing a remote team member to access a development server on your machine.
* Setting up a persistent C2 channel.

## Important Note:

> By default, remote forwarded ports are only accessible from the SSH server itself. To allow other hosts on the remote network to connect, you might need to add `-g` (gateway ports) to the SSH command, or configure `GatewayPorts yes` in the SSH server's `sshd_config`.
