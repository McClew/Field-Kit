# Local Port Forwarding

Local port forwarding allows you to forward a port on your local machine to a port on a remote machine, through an SSH server. This is useful for accessing a service on a private network from your local machine, where the SSH server acts as an intermediary.

> **Scenario:** You want to access a web server running on `192.168.1.100` on port `80` (an internal host), but you only have SSH access to a jump host (`jumpbox.example.com`) that can reach `192.168.1.100`.

## Command:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:192.168.1.100:80 user@jumpbox.example.com
```

### Explanation:

* `-L 8080`: Specifies that a local port `8080` on your machine will be used.
* `192.168.1.100`: The destination IP address (the internal web server).
* `80`: The destination port on `192.168.1.100` (the web server's port).
* `user@jumpbox.example.com`: The SSH credentials and address of the jump host.

After executing this command, you can open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. Your traffic will be forwarded through `jumpbox.example.com` to `192.168.1.100:80`.

## Use Cases:

* Accessing internal web applications.
* Connecting to internal databases.
* Bypassing client-side firewall restrictions.
