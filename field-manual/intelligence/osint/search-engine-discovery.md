# Search Engine Discovery

**Search engine discovery** leverages the immense power of search algorithms to extract data that may not be readily visible on websites. Security professionals and researchers can delve deep into the indexed web by employing specialised search operators, techniques, and tools, uncovering everything from employee information and sensitive documents to hidden login pages and exposed credentials.

The information you can pull together from Search Engines can be applied in several different ways:

* **Security Assessment:** Identifying vulnerabilities, exposed data, and potential attack vectors.
* **Competitive Intelligence:** Gathering information about competitors' products, services, and strategies.
* **Investigative Journalism:** Uncovering hidden connections, financial transactions, and unethical practices.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Identifying emerging threats, tracking malicious actors, and predicting potential attacks.
