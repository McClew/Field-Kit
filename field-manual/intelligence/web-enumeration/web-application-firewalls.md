**Web Application Firewalls** (**WAF**s) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if acme.com employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

To detect the presence of a WAF tools such as wafw00f can be used.
