# Intelligence

This section details reconnaissance and information gathering activities performed throughout a cybersecurity engagement, encompassing _both_ initial pre-exploitation efforts and subsequent post-exploitation reconnaissance. This phase focuses on systematically collecting relevant data about the target environment, its infrastructure, and its personnel.

The primary goal of intelligence gathering is to build a comprehensive understanding of the target's attack surface, identify potential vulnerabilities, and inform subsequent attack path planning and lateral movement. This involves:

* **Initial Reconnaissance:** Prior to any direct exploitation, this involves passively and actively discovering and mapping the target's network, hosts, services, and web presence to identify initial points of entry and understand the external attack surface.
* **Post-Exploitation Reconnaissance:** Once initial access is gained, intelligence gathering shifts to internal network discovery, host enumeration, and privilege escalation reconnaissance to identify additional assets, trust relationships, and pathways for lateral movement and further compromise.

By thoroughly understanding the target's landscape and potential weaknesses, the intelligence phase provides the critical foundation for effective and targeted exploitation.
